Instructions for pairing:

 Step 1: Pair controler in the Bluetooth Manager on the top bar and make sure your first step is "Add" or "Add device".

 Step 2: once paired correctly proceed to the next step.

 Step 3: Now its kinda paired but not really (dont worry you dont have to do that last step everytime).

 Step 4: Open Terminal,  type: ds4drv and hit enter. Now, turn off the DS4 by holding the Playstation button for 10 seconds. You'll know this has happend when its light turns off. Then, hold the Share and the Playstation button (PS) simultaneously until the controller starts flashing. First, a single flash, then, two quick flashes, repeatedly. After this, ds4drv should find and connect your DS4, finishing the pairing process. Your controller will now emit blue light. You need to keep this terminal process running in the background as long as you use the DS4.

 Step 5: There are 3 different preset configurations available. You can cycle through them by pressing L1 + R1 + PS simultaneously. Each mode makes the controller emit a different color of light.
 
1 ) Blue = Dualshock 4
     
2 ) Red = Xbox. ds4drv will now present your DS4 as an xbox controller to the computer, allowing you to play certain games that only support xbox button mapping.
     
3 ) Green = Mouse and keyboard.
